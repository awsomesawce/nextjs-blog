# Notes about my experience

## This is my first experience running a dev server on my computer to execute a .js based webapp.

It is now being hosted [here](http://localhost:3000)

What are the implications?

I guess if I did this and executed bad code i could potentially fuck up my system.  That's not the case if you ran it in a container, like on a **remote dev server!!**
